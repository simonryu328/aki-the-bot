## Learnings

- Memory Management: Long-term relationship building requires a hybrid memory system that combines structured historical data with semantic retrieval to maintain context over months of interaction.
- Proactivity: Moving from a reactive chatbot to a proactive companion involves complex orchestration of scheduled tasks and state management to ensure messages feel timely rather than intrusive.
- Personalization at Scale: Generating unique, daily content (journals, quotes, playlists) for each user requires efficient prompt templating and careful token management to balance quality with cost.
- UI/UX in Mini Apps: Building a premium-feeling experience within the Telegram ecosystem necessitates a highly responsive frontend and creative use of the Telegram WebApp SDK to bridge the gap between chat and app.
